The Volunteer Module (VM) for Sahana is a system to track volunteers and projects in the context of an incident.

INSTALLATION

If you already have a copy of Sahana installed:
* place the 'vm' directory inside the 'mod' subdirectory of your Sahana installation
* run the 'dbcreate.sql' script located in the 'ins' directory

If you plan on installing a new copy of Sahana, just make sure the 'vm' directory is inside your 'mod' directory.
The Sahana installer will take care of running the MySQL script.

DEVELOPMENT NOTE FOR INTERNATIONALIZATION (version 1.4+)

Before running gettext on this module, you will need to run the utility mod/vm/tools/tpl2inc.php tp generate files
gettext can parse. Make sure the mod/vm/tpl2inc folder is writable by php. tpl2inc.php is documented in its
code.
